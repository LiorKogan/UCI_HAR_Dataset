### General

This document describes the input data and output data of the script defined in "run_analysis.R".

The output data can be generated by executing 
```r
source('run_analysis.R')
```
(run_analysis.R is explained in README.md)

Alternatively, the output data  can loaded by executing 
```r
actSubjAvg <- read.table("act_subj_avg.txt")
```

### The input data

The input data is the following 8 files:

Training set:

 - "test/y_test.txt" - each row (2947 rows) identifies the activity type, for each window sample (integer: 1-6)
 - "test/subject_test.txt" - each row (2947 rows) identifies the subject who performed the activity, for each window sample (integer: 2,4,9,10,12,13,18,20,24)
 - "test/X_test.txt" - each row (2974 rows) represents one subject involved in one activity type (identified in the two files described above) in one window sample, each column (561 columns) contains the measured value for one measurement type - for the given activity and subject (numerical)
 
Test set:

 - "train/y_train.txt" - each row (7352 rows) identifies the activity type, for each window sample (integer: 1-6)
 - "train/subject_train.txt" - each row (7352 rows) identifies the subject who performed the activity, for each window sample (integer: 1,3,5-8,11,14-17,19,21-23,25-30)
 - "train/X_train.txt" - each row (7352 rows) represents one subject involved in one activity type (identified in the two files described above) in one window sample, each column (561 columns) contains the measured value for one measurement type - for the given activity and subject (numerical)
 
Descriptive names:

 - "activity_labels.txt" - contains the names of the 6 activity types (col.1: Seq.no, col.2: activity name)
 - "features.txt" - contains the names of the 561 measurement types (features) (col.1: Seq.no, col.2: measurement name)
 
### The output data - meansStds

This is a matrix with 10299 rows and 87 columns.

Each row represents one observation (one test: one subject involved in one activity type, in one window sample). Training data set and test set are combined.

The columns:

 1 - activity type

    the activity type in with the subject was engaged
    type: categorical - descriptive name
    values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
             (represented as a factor (1-6) with labels)
    note: labels order may change is saved as a text file 
          (That's how R saves text files. Save as RData to overcome this problem)

 2-87 - 

	The measured/calculated value for the given observation and feature.
	Each column represent a specific feature.
    The selection of these specific features is explained in README.md
    type: numerical (all features)

<h3>General</h3>

<p>This document describes the structure of the tidy data frame that can be produced either by:</p>

<ul>
<li>loading     - Loading the act_subj_avg.txt text file in R using read.table</li>
<li>generating  - Executing the run_analysis.R script generates a data frame named actSubjAvg</li>
</ul>

<p>The run_analysis.R script is explained in the README.md file</p>

<p>The data frame has 180 observations (rows) and 88 variables (columns)</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<p>Each observation represent one volunteers and one activity.
There is a total of 30 volunteers and 6 activities.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>1 - activity
    the activity in with the subject was engaged
    values : 1: WALKING, 2: WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3: WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4: SITTING, 5: STANDING, 6: LAYING
             (defined as a factor with labels)
    note: labels order may change is saved as a text file 
          (That&#39;s how R saves text files. Save as RData to overcome this problem)</p>

<p>2 - subject
    volunteers number
    values: 1-30</p>

<p>Columns 3-88 contain the mean over all measurements (training data and test data) for the given activity (column 1) and subject (column 2)</p>

<p>Only variables which measures mean and standard deviation are included.</p>

<p>The averaged variables are </p>
